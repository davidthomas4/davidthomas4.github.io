      <p>Hello, my name is David Thomas. Welcome to my webpage.</p>
      <p> I am currently a PhD student at Lancaster University in the
Condensed Matter Theory group. I work with <a
href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/drummonn/">Neil Drummond</a>
using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods to study low-dimensional
quantum systems. Some of my recent work includes studying excitonic
complexes in type-II semiconductor nanostructures such as quantum
rings and superlattices, as well as in monolayer transition metal
dichalcogenides. I have also perfmormed <em>ab-initio</em>
calculations of defect formation energies in graphene.</p>
      <p>Outside of academia I am a keen runner and orienteer, with
a particular interest in the navigation aspect of the orienteering. I
have been in Scouting for many years, and still attend troop nights on
a weekly basis as a leader. I closely follow the Formula 1 motor
racing championship.</p>
